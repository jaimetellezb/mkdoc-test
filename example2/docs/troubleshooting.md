# Troubleshooting

This section addresses common issues and their solutions.

## Common Issues

### ListView Not Rendering

If the ListView is not rendering:

1. **Check Data Binding**: Ensure that the data array is correctly bound to the widget.
2. **Console Errors**: Open the browser's console and look for any errors related to the ListView.

### Event Handlers Not Working

If event handlers like `itemClick` are not working:

1. **Event Binding**: Ensure that the event is correctly bound using the `.on()` method.
2. **Event Delegation**: Verify that the elements are correctly targeted within the event handler.

## Debugging Tips

- Use `console.log()` to print variables and check their values.
- Enable verbose logging in your development environment for more detailed output.
